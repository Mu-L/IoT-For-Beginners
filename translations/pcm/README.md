# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates for Microsoft happy to offer 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum wey dey teach IoT basics. Every lesson get pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to finish the lesson, solution, assignment and more. Our project-based style dey allow you learn as you dey build, na proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

The projects cover di journey of food from farm go table. This one include farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail and consumer - all na popular industry areas for IoT devices.

> **Teachers**, we don [include some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you want create your own lessons, we don also include [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use dis curriculum on your own, fork di entire repo and complete the exercises by yourself, starting with pre-lecture quiz, then read the lecture and finish the other activities. Try create the projects by understanding the lessons instead of just copying the solution code; but that code dey available for /solutions folders for each project lesson. Another idea na to form study group with friends and go through di content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy

We choose two pedagoji principles while we dey build dis curriculum: to make sure say e get project-based style and e get frequent quizzes. By di time you finish this series, you go don build plant monitoring and watering system, vehicle tracker, smart factory wey dey track and check food, and voice-controlled cooking timer, and go don learn the basics of Internet of Things including how to write device code, connect to cloud, analyze telemetry and run AI for edge.

By making sure say di content match projects, di process go dey more interesting for students and e go help better retention of concepts.

Also, low-stakes quiz before class dey set the student mindset to learn topic, while second quiz after class dey make sure say dem remember well. This curriculum design na flexible and fun and you fit take all or part of am. The projects start small and get more hard as you reach di end of di 12 week cycle.

Each project base on real-world hardware wey students and hobbyists fit get. Each project dey look into im specific domain, providing correct background knowledge. To be successful developer e good to sabi di domain wey you dey solve problem; providing dis background knowledge dey help students reason about their IoT solutions and learnings with respect to real-world problem wey dem fit face as IoT developer. Students go learn the 'why' behind the solutions wey dem dey build, and go appreciate di end user well well.

## Hardware

We get two pilihan for IoT hardware wey fit use for di projects based on personal preference, programming language knowledge or preference, learning goals and availability. We also provide 'virtual hardware' version for people wey no get hardware or wey wan learn well before dem buy. You fit read more and see 'shopping list' for di [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to buy complete kits from our friends at Seeed Studio.

## Each lesson get:

- sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- [post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **Note about quizzes**: All quizzes dey for quiz-app folder, we get 48 quizzes total with three questions each. Dem link dem from inside lessons but quiz app fit run locally or e fit deploy for Azure; follow instruction for `quiz-app` folder. Dem dey slowly dey localize dem.
