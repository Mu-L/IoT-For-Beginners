# Compare domains

## Instructions

When you created your object detector, you had the option to choose from several domains. Compare how well they perform for your stock detector and explain which one provides better results.

To switch the domain, click the **Settings** button in the top menu, select a new domain, click the **Save changes** button, and then retrain the model. Ensure you test the model using the new iteration trained with the updated domain.

## Rubric
